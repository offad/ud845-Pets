## Pets App
===================================

Used in a Udacity course in the Beginning Android Nanodegree.

Based on the Pets Shelter Project from the [Android Basics: Data Storage](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud845) section of the Android Basics Course.


## Description 

This app displays a list of pets and their related data that the user inputs. 

## Evaluation
+ Using SQLite to store app data in a database
+ Hooking up a contract class to standardise a Cursor object to handle database transactions
+ Design a ContentProvider to provide data to the app using URIs
+ Enhancing UX by implementing a CursorAdapter and CursorLoader to allow users to select and edit information they've saved off
